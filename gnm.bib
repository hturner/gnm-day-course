Statistical Software for Categorical Data Analysis Appendix B. Chi-Squared Distribution Values References Author Index Example Index Subject Index. "A classic in its own right, this book continues to provide an introduction to modern generalized linear models for categorical variables. The text emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered, correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book. R and SAS are now showcased as the software of choice.

	structural modelling involving exogenous variables. Models include
	0–3 factors (age, period and cohort). Decomposition and disaggregation
	are also used in multistate models, including macrosimulation and
	microsimulation. Forecasting demographic change is difficult; accuracy
	depends on the particular situation or trends, but it is not clear
	when a method will perform best. Estimates of uncertainty (model-based
	ex ante error, expert-opinion-based ex ante error, and ex post error)
	differ; uncertainty estimation is highly uncertain. Probabilistic
	population forecasts are based on stochastic population renewal or
	random scenarios. The approaches to population forecasting, demographic
	process forecasting and error estimation are closely linked. Complementary
	methods that combine approaches are increasingly employed. The paper
	summarises developments, assesses progress and considers the future.},

  year = {2009},
  volume = {68},
  pages = {1835--42},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {Numerous studies consider the role of social, or occupational, mobility
	on health inequalities. A common conclusion is that social mobility
	constrains, rather than widens, social class health inequalities.
	It is argued that such 'gradient constraint' occurs because movers
	into higher social classes tend to have poorer health than those
	they join, while movers into lower social classes tend to have better
	health than those they join. This has led to the suggestion that
	increasing social mobility may be an effective policy to reduce health
	inequalities. However, this raises a paradox as many studies also
	show that health inequalities are widening. We compare class mobility
	and deprivation mobility between 1971 and 1991 with health in 1991
	in England and Wales. In both cases, the health in 1991 of the 'mobile'
	tended to fall between that of those they left and those they joined.
	In comparison to the socially stable, the gradient was thus constrained.
	However, comparing the health in 1991 of everyone by their class/deprivation
	position in 1991 and 1971, the overall social class health gradient
	was little different, while the deprivation health gap was considerably
	wider in 1991. These results show that a reduction in inequalities
	is not a necessary consequence if the health of 'mobile' people falls
	between that of those they left and those they joined and this is
	particularly the case for deprivation mobility.},

	the mobility effect to be an increase of 52\% for males and 28\%
	for females (situation of no causation) and the lower bound to be
	a decrease of 24\% for males and 21\% for females (situation of no

	METHODS: 1040 sons and 1298 daughters aged 30-59 from 1477 families
	reported their alcohol consumption from which was derived: weekly
	units (1 UK unit being 8 g ethanol), exceeding daily or weekly limits,
	binge drinking and consuming alcohol on 5+ days per week. Own and
	father's social class were available enabling social mobility to
	be investigated. RESULTS: More downwardly mobile men exceeded the
	weekly limit, the daily limit, were defined as binge drinkers and
	drank the most units per week of the four social mobility groups.
	Stable non-manual women were more likely to consume alcohol on 5+
	days a week but very few were binge drinkers. Stable non-manual and
	upwardly mobile men and women were more likely to drink wine, and
	downwardly mobile men to drink beer. CONCLUSIONS: Downward mobility
	was associated with less favourable alcohol behaviours, especially
	in men. Wine consumption was more closely related to the social mobility
	groups than beer and spirits consumption. Drinking patterns could
	both influence and be influenced by social mobility.},

	For generalized linear models a necessary and sufficient condition
	is given for the existence of a penalized likelihood interpretation
	of the method. An illustrative application to the Goodman row-column

	associated with self-assessed health and smoking, for men and women.
	Accounting for both partners’ education the social gradient in

	might emerge a degree of ideological closure in the service class

	birth cohort study is used to investigate this question. Longitudinal
	data are invaluable here because they allow us to distinguish between
	two hypotheses: that upward mobility as such has induced in the service
	class certain attitudes and propensities to participate, or that
	the more important influence is the early socialization through which
	upwardly mobile people went. The conclusion of the analysis is that,
	although the civic values of the service class have not depended
	on upward mobility, this is much more true of cognitively able people
	than of others, and so is dependent on the somewhat meritocratic
	basis of selection into the salariat.},

	1945-59 (N=791 846) were followed up for CVD mortality 1990-2002
	(2019 deaths) by means of logistic regression analysis. CVD mortality
	risks were estimated for 16 mobility trajectories. Gross and net
	impact of four childhood and four adult classes, based on occupation,
	were analysed for mortality in ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke,
	other CVD, - and all CVD. Differences between the two most extreme
	trajectories were 10-fold, but the common trajectory of moving from
	manual to non-manual position was linked to only a slight excess
	mortality (OR=1.26) compared to the equally common trajectory of
	maintaining a stable non-manual position (reference category). Moving
	into adult manual class resulted in an elevated CVD mortality whatever
	the childhood position (ORs varied between 1.42 and 2.24). After
	adjustment for adult class, childhood class had some effect, in particular
	there was a low risk of coming from a self-employed childhood class
	on all outcomes (all ORs around=0.80). A woman's own education had
	a stronger influence on the mortality estimates than did household
	income. Social mobility trajectories among Swedish women are linked
	to their CVD mortality risk. Educational achievement seems to be
	a key factor for intergenerational continuity and discontinuity in
	class-related risk of CVD mortality among Swedish women. However,
	on mutual adjustment, adult class was much more closely related to

  abstract = {Human senescence has been delayed by a decade. This finding, documented
	in 1994 and bolstered since, is a fundamental discovery about the
	biology of human ageing, and one with profound implications for individuals,
	society and the economy. Remarkably, the rate of deterioration with
	age seems to be constant across individuals and over time: it seems
	that death is being delayed because people are reaching old age in
	better health. Research by demographers, epidemiologists and other
	biomedical researchers suggests that further progress is likely to
	be made in advancing the frontier of survival - and healthy survival
	- to even greater ages.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between health behaviors and
	socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood and adult life. METHODS:
	Self-reported diet, smoking, and physical activity were determined
	among 3523 women aged 60 to 79 years recruited from general practices
	in 23 British towns from 1999 through 2001. RESULTS: The most affluent
	women reported eating more fruit, vegetables, chicken, and fish and
	less red or processed meat than did less affluent women. Affluent
	women were less likely to smoke and more likely to exercise. Life
	course SES did not influence the types of fat, bread, and milk consumed.
	Adult SES predicted consumption of all foods considered and predicted
	smoking and physical activity habits independently of childhood SES.
	Childhood SES predicted fruit and vegetable consumption independently
	of adult SES and, to a lesser extent, predicted physical activity.
	Downward social mobility over the life course was associated with
	poorer diets and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Among older
	women, healthful eating and physical activity were associated with
	both current and childhood SES. Interventions designed to improve
	social inequalities in health behaviors should be applied during
	both childhood and adult life.},
